# Programming API

This is a walkthrough on all the engine's core features made available for programmers, who want to
make game using this engine in c++, instead of using the editor. You will want to do this, if you like
reading documents, have a good knack for understanding other's code and also if you are or want to be
good at programming in C++.

___BTW, Everest Editor is made using the core Everest-Engine library. So, don't be surprised with things
you can do with everest engine library.___
