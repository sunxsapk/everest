# Everest Engine Setup

Setting up everest engine on your machine requires you to first of all, install all the dependencies
then build it from source code.

___Take in consideration that the project is currently under continous development, so feedback on
some bugs found, feature requests, etc are highly appreciated.___

Clone the repository and go into the project directory and then we'll get started on spicy stuffs.
``` bash
    git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/sunxsapk/everest
    cd everest
```

## Installing using scripts

There are platform specific scripts provided to you for shedding off the load of installing all of the
dependencies yourself.

__1. Linux__ : `./scripts/linux/install_dependencies.sh`
__2. MacOS__ : `./scripts/macos/install_dependencies.sh`
__3. Windows__ 
Run the following commands on Window's powershell. This script first installs __chocolatey__(package
manager for windows) and then install dependencies from there.
- `Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force`
- `./scripts/windows/install_dependencies.ps1`

If Powershell blocks the execution, you may need to allow scripts:
- `Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope CurrentUser`

## Building the engine

__1. Linux__ : `./scripts/linux/build_editor.sh`
__2. MacOS__ : `./scripts/macos/build_editor.sh`
__3. Windows__ : `./scripts/windows/build_editor.ps1`

---

## Building the engine

__1. Linux__ : `./scripts/linux/run_editor.sh`
__2. MacOS__ : `./scripts/macos/run_editor.sh`
__3. Windows__ : `./scripts/windows/run_editor.ps1`

---

## Customizing the build

Run commands yourself the project after cloning the repo for different build options:
- Run `cmake -B build` from root project directory to build the project
    Setting options : `-D[option]=[value]`
    - Build modes [Debug, Release, Dist]: 
        Example:- `cmake -B build -DBuild=Debug` ...  `cmake -B build -DBuild=Release`
    - Build Target [Editor, Game]: Example:-  `cmake -B build -DTarget=Editor` or `cmake -B build -DTarget=Editor`

- For setting up Engine as build target : run `cmake -B build -DBuild=Dist -DTarget=Editor`
- Build the project using `cmake --build build/`
- Run editor using `./build/bin/everest-editor/everest-editor`

__As of now, Game is unbuildable from editor. If you want to run a game you've edited then you can do
so by writing some C++ code for running the saved scenes. Building the game form the editor will be
made available soon.__

__For an example on how to run a game out of editor, checkout the following example game scene running
standalone.__
- For setting up Game as build target   : run `cmake -B build -DBuild=Dist -DTarget=Game`
- Build the project using `cmake --build build/`
- Run game using `./build/bin/examples/examples`

__If you've installed dependencies using scripts, then you are good to go. Else you can continue reading
the guide below.__
