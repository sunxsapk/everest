# Developer Notes

Building a game engine froms scratch is a huge task in hand. So, I have a plan
to put everything together in a very easy way for development purpose. Things
will proceed in following sequence :-

    - Project will have a master builder which will build 2 subprojects.
    - First project it will build is everest-engine.
    - Then, it will build the game.

    When will the scene/level-editor be built then?
    - Immediately after the scene is made serializable.

Now, let's talk about the milestones of the project:

- First target is making a Event-System which will be used by the GLFW window,
    to dispatch some events to the Application layers.
    Components: Debug-Logger, Key-Events, Mouse-Events, Window-Events,
                Window, Application, Layer
    Target: Log each events on the console with detail info

- Establish  a rendering system with movable camera system, that can draw basic
    shapes on the window.
    Components: Camera(Main-Camera), Renderer, Rectangle, Circle, Line, Triangle
    Target: Move a object(Shape) around screen, using key-inputs, mouse-inputs
        and if possible with window-move events too.
