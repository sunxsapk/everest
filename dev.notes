============ Developer Notes =================

Building a game engine from scratch is a huge task in hand. So, I have a plan
to put everything together in a very easy way for development purpose. Things
will proceed in following sequence :-

    - Project will have a master builder which will build 2 subprojects.
    - First project it will build is everest-engine.
    - Then, it will build the game.

    When will the scene/level-editor be built then?
    - Immediately after the scene is made serializable.

=============== Roadmap ======================

+ Rendering Texture
+ Entity Component System
+ Serialization
+ Scene Format
+ Tools (editor & stuff)
+ Physics System
+ Scripting
+ Make a game run inside editor completely
- Standalone game build & run system
- Models format, (asset bundles)

=============== Milestones to achieve ===================

- Sprite atlas UI (texture load settings)
- Develop 3D rendering system (mesh load and rendering, materials and shaders)

=============== Bugs =============

- Not a bug, but discrete collision detection implemented here is not working fine for high speed collisions

=============== TODO ============
[ ] update api docs
[ ] project file format, working directory setup
