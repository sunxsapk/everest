============ Developer Notes =================

Building a game engine from scratch is a huge task in hand. So, I have a plan
to put everything together in a very easy way for development purpose. Things
will proceed in following sequence :-

    - Project will have a master builder which will build 2 subprojects.
    - First project it will build is everest-engine.
    - Then, it will build the game.

    When will the scene/level-editor be built then?
    - Immediately after the scene is made serializable.

=============== Roadmap ======================

+ Rendering Texture
+ Entity Component System
+ Serialization
+ Scene Format
+ Tools (editor & stuff)
+ Physics System
+ Scripting
+ Make a game run inside editor completely
- Standalone game build & run system
- Models format, (asset bundles)

=============== Milestones to achieve ===================

- Sprite atlas UI (texture load settings)
- Develop 3D rendering system (mesh load and rendering, materials and shaders)

=============== Bugs =============

1. Just found out that, at some point, when two objects are colliding at high speed, some value turns
out to be infinity or nan, so all the objects vanish. So, check the vulnerable point and abort
before such behaviour is encountered

=============== TODO ============
[ ] update api docs
[ ] make a simple demo game scene
[ ] fix bugs...
[ ] project file format, working directory setup
